We have to develop with java for android, so I though that it would be interesting to use an specific "Android-Java-IDE" in order do it.
If you agree, we would have to find some documentation about the best way to structure the project and which is the best IDE to do that job.

If is possible, the ideal IDE would have to be compatible with MAC and Linux for compatibility reasons :)
